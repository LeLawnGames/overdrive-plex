Order of operations:

01: Download .odm files
02: Use sh overdrivedelete.sh to unpack
03: Use chapters_list.py to get the chapters times and titles
04: Use metadatatoxml.py to get xml
05: Use xmlparse.py to clean metadata
06: Use chapter_ms.py to put the chapter times in ms
07: Use durations.py to create the duration spans in the chapter file
08: Use 00_exportchapters.py to get the labeled audio, pull the metadata txt & folder.jpg into the new folder, and move the old folder to archive
09: Use final_metadata_add.py to add metadata to the tracks and move the author folders to 02_READY FOR PLEX
10: Drag to Plex -- the odm download and this part are the two manuals components and I consider those safeguards. Worst case scenario if something went wrong you'd probably see it during this step and you could revert to the archives.
